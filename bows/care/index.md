## Cleaning

- **Hand Wash**:
  Fill a basin with lukewarm water (<30&deg;) and add a small amount of mild detergent.
  Submerge the bow and gently swish it around.
  Avoid scrubbing the embroidered area. Let it soak for a few minutes.

- **Rinse**:
  Rinse thoroughly with lukewarm water to remove any soap residue.

- **Drying**:
  Lay the bow flat on a clean, dry towel.
  Roll the towel up to remove excess water without wringing or twisting the fabric.
  Reshape the bow and let it air dry flat on another clean, dry towel away from direct sunlight.

## Storage

- **Avoid Crushing**:
  Store the bow in a way that avoids crushing the fabric or embroidery. You can hang it or place it flat in a drawer.

- **Keep Away from Moisture**:
  Store in a dry place to prevent mildew or mold growth.

- **Protection from Dust**:
  Place the bow in a breathable fabric bag or cover it with a cloth to protect it from dust.

## General Maintenance

- **Avoid Direct Heat**:
  Do not iron directly on the embroidery. If needed, iron on the reverse side or place a cloth between the iron and the bow.

- **Spot Cleaning**:
  For small stains, gently dab the area with a damp cloth and mild soap. Rinse with a clean damp cloth.

- **Avoid Harsh Chemicals**:
  Do not use bleach or strong detergents as they can damage the fabric and embroidery.

## By following these care instructions, your embroidered fabric bow should stay beautiful and intact for a long time.
